Version 0.6 (ongoing):
	cphase was erroneously called cnot
	added correct cnot gate

	fixed Hadamard gate for Sage's SR
	full/partial trace function
	eigenvectors function
	diagonal matrix factory function
	random_array gives complex values
	0-d arrays always have int size (not 1.0)
	matrix pow operator
	apply_map function

Version 0.4 (2011-03-13):
	don't test for Sage on every base_field_lookup call
	custom matrix norm that works on Sage's SR
	more package metadata

Version 0.3 (2011-03-11):
	Python type arrays can use Sage rendering in Sage
	Sage support without mixins
	renamed some modules (no API changes)
	unary negation
	Pauli states and some circuit operators
	input data is cast for Sage base fields

Version 0.2 (2011-03-10):
