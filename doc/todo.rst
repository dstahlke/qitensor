    * 'assert' doesn't give useful message now that Cython is being used
    * redeclaring HilbertAtom can't change latex label
    * set formatting options on sage examples (including webpage)
    * detect when running under 'ipython qtconsole' and disable mathjax in html
    * sage doctests in python files give sphinx error
